I thought it would be cool if I could get information on a place (for example weather, popular spots and news), store diffrent destinatons for comparisons,
I am always looking for an app that I can do lots of reaserch on without clicking and googling lots of diffrent websites

this uses google map api, along side various other open source tools to create a holiday planner app.
